# useEffect

When we're using the `useEffect` hook, React gives us a way to control when the
side effect function will run. What is it?

## Correct

By passing a second argument to `useEffect` of a dependencies array.

> Correct! By passing a dependencies array to the `useEffect` hook, React can
> determine whether or not it is necessary to call the side effect function
> based on whether the variables in that dependencies array have changed from
> one render to the next.

## Incorrect

By running a cleanup function in a `useEffect` callback function.

> Cleanup functions are useful if you have a long-running function that you want
> to unsubscribe from when the component is no longer on the page. The side
> effect function will always run before the cleanup function, so the cleanup
> function doesn't control when the side effect function will run.

## Incorrect

By calling the `useEffect` inside an if/else statement.

> Be careful here! As with all hooks, always use `useEffect` at the top level of
> your React function. Hooks should never be called conditionally. Check out the
> [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) for more information
> on this.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
