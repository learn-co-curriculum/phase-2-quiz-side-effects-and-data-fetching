React gives us a way to control when the side effect will run. What is it?

## Correct

By passing a second argument to `useEffect` of a dependencies array.

## Incorrect

By running a cleanup function in a `useEffect` callback function.

> Cleanup functions are useful if you have a long-running function that you want
> to unsubscribe from when the component is no longer on the page.

## Incorrect

By calling the `useEffect` inside an if/else statement.

> As with all hooks, always use `useEffect` at the top level of your React
> function, before any early returns.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> Check out the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) for more
> information on this.

I don't know.
