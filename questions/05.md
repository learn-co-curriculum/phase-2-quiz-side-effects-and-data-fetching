# useEffect

This code will successfully update our component's state after receiving the
response from our request.

```js
function TweetList() {
  const [tweets, setTweets] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json")
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setTweets(data.tweets);
      });
  }, []);

  // return JSX...
}
```
