Natasha is building a Twitter clone, and is trying to fetch some data from the Twitter API when her App component loads. What is the best approach to doing this?

## Correct

Using the `useEffect` hook to fetch all the tweets she initially needs.

## Incorrect

Making the user click a button and handling the fetch request in the click event handler.

> By default,&nbsp;`useEffect`&nbsp;will run our side effect function every time
> the component re-renders.

## Incorrect

Making the fetch request directly in the body of the component function.

> By default,&nbsp;`useEffect`&nbsp;will run our side effect function every time
> the component re-renders.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
