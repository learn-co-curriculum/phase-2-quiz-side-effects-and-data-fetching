# useEffect

When and why should we use a cleanup function with `useEffect`?

## Correct

If we have a long running function that we want to stop running when our
component is no longer the page.

> Spot on! The reason React provides us with the ability to clean up after our
> side effect functions is to avoid memory leaks, and prevent unneeded code from
> running in the background.

## Incorrect

Any time we make a network request with `fetch`.

> While it can be helpful on occasion to use a cleanup function with network
> requests (for example, to cancel a request if the component is removed from the
> page before the request completes), it's not necessary to do so for every
> network request.

## Incorrect

Always, just to be safe.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
