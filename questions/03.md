# Natasha now wants to add CRUD to her users profiles, should she put this PATCH request in a useEffect hook or attach it to an event listener?

Natasha now wants to add CRUD to her users profiles in her Twitter clone, should she put this PATCH request in a `useEffect` hook or attach it to an event listener?

## Correct

Event listener, because she only wants the fetch to fire when the user is done
updating their profile.

## Incorrect

useEffect, because she needs the data immediately when the page loads.

> Because she is making a Patch request to update her user's profile, it would
> make more sense to make this request when the user is done updating.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
