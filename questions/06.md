# What will happen when the following code runs?

What will happen when the following code runs?

```
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/3")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => {
    // setting state in the useEffect callback
    setImages(data.messages);
  });
});
```

## Correct

Running this code will result in an endless loop of fetch requests.

## Incorrect

Our component will re-render once after calling `setImages` and the `useEffect`
callback won't run again.

> We don't want to make a network request every time our component is updated,

> a&nbsp; **dependencies array**.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
