# What will happen when the following code runs?

What will happen when the following code runs?

```jsx
function DogImages() {
  const [dogImages, setDogImages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/3")
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((data) => {
        // setting state in the useEffect callback
        setDogImages(data.messages);
      });
  });

  // return JSX...
}
```

## Correct

Running this code will result in an endless loop of fetch requests.

> Right! By default, the `useEffect` hook will run our side effect after every
> render, unless we provide a dependencies array as a second argument. Since
> calling `setDogImages` will trigger a re-render of our component, this will
> result in an endless loop of fetching and setting state.

## Incorrect

Our component will re-render once after calling `setDogImages` and
the`useEffect`callback won't run again.

> We don't want to make a network request every time our component is updated,
> only the first time our component renders. To control our side effects, React
> gives us the option of passing a second argument to `useEffect` of a
> **dependencies array**. By default, the `useEffect` hook will run our side
> effect after every render, unless we provide a dependencies array as a second
> argument. Since calling `setDogImages` will trigger a re-render of our
> component, this will result in an endless loop of fetching and setting state.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
